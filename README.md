3D Network Visualization with Three.js
Welcome to the 3D Network Visualization project! This React-based project uses Three.js and @react-three/fiber to render a 3D interactive model of nodes and their connections, providing an immersive, animated experience for users. Designed to resemble a network of "mount sticks" and "pipes," this visualization is both interactive and visually striking.

Deployment: Live Demo
Credits: Project by Mithilesh Kumar

Features
3D Interactive Model: Pan, zoom, and rotate the model to explore the full network.
Mount Stick and Pipe Representation: Nodes are represented as spheres, and connections are depicted as tubular pipes.
Customizable View: Adjust node and line size, colors, and lighting to enhance visibility and focus.
Dynamic Camera and Controls: OrbitControls for smooth user interaction with the 3D model.
Performance Optimization: Efficient rendering with Suspense and lighting optimizations for real-time interaction.
Project Setup

Technical Details
Core Technologies
React: Frontend framework for managing components and state.
Three.js: JavaScript library for creating and rendering 3D graphics.
@react-three/fiber: React renderer for Three.js, enabling 3D graphics within React components.
@react-three/drei: Provides useful helpers like OrbitControls for smooth user interactions.
Structure and Code
App.js: Core of the 3D model. This file sets up the scene, camera, nodes, and connections between nodes.
Node Component: Defines each nodeâ€™s appearance and position.
Connection Component: Renders lines between nodes to represent connections.
Network Component: Combines all nodes and connections into a cohesive network.
Canvas Styling: The canvas is set to fullscreen with a black background for high contrast, using CSS for a visually immersive experience.
Customization
You can easily customize this project:

Node and Pipe Size: Modify the sphere radius and line thickness for a different look.
Colors: Adjust colors for the nodes and lines to fit your preferences.
Lighting and Background: Customize ambient and directional lights to create different moods.
Future Enhancements
Dynamic Data Loading: Fetch data dynamically for networks with real-time data updates.
Additional Effects: Implement more lighting and animation effects for further immersion.
Expanded Interactivity: Add features like hover effects, tooltips, or click-to-expand node information.
